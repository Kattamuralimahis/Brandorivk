# Brandorivk Storefront

Simple ecommerce storefront (HTML/CSS/JS).

## Short answer

**Yes — you can push code to GitHub.**

You only need to connect this local repo to your GitHub repo URL and run `git push`.

## Exact answer: how to push this code to GitHub and make it live

I am giving only the exact steps you need.

### 1) Create empty GitHub repo
- In GitHub, click **New repository**.
- Name it (example: `Brandorivk`).
- Keep it **empty** (do not add README/license/gitignore).

### 2) Run these commands in your project folder

```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
git remote -v
```

If `git remote -v` shows nothing, run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

If it shows wrong URL, run:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

Now push your current branch (`work`) to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin work
```

If you want the main branch instead, run:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

After this, refresh GitHub — your code will appear.

### 3) Make website live (GitHub Pages)

This repo already has a GitHub Pages workflow file at:
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`

Do this in GitHub:
1. Open repo → **Settings** → **Pages**.
2. In **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
3. Open **Actions** tab and run the deploy workflow (or push one more commit).
4. Wait 1–3 minutes.

Live URL will be:

```text
https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/
```

### 4) If push fails (quick fix)
Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) as password when terminal asks credentials.

## Local preview

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Open: `http://127.0.0.1:4173`


## Important: what to type in terminal

Do not type the characters `<` or `>` in commands.
Use your real GitHub values directly, for example: `your-username` and `your-repo`.

Do **not** type markdown markers like ```bash and do **not** type prompt text like `@Kattamuralimahis ➜ ... $`.

Type only these commands, one by one:

```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
git remote -v
```

If remote is empty, then type:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```


## If commands show "nothing" (blank output)

This is normal in some cases:

- `git remote -v` blank => no remote is connected yet.
- `git status` saying "nothing to commit" => repo is clean (not an error).

Then run exactly:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

If your branch is `work`, run:

```bash
git push -u origin work
```


## Push entire website code to GitHub (copy-paste)

Run these commands in your project folder:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update website"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

If remote already exists, use this instead of `git remote add`:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```


## What "Everything up-to-date" means

This means your code is already pushed to GitHub successfully.

- `branch ... set up to track 'origin/main'` => your local branch is connected to GitHub remote branch.
- `Everything up-to-date` => no new local commits to push (GitHub already has the latest code).

Next step to make site live:
1. Open GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Pages**.
2. Set source to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Open **Actions** tab and run the Pages deploy workflow (or push any small new commit).
4. Wait 1–3 minutes and open: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/`.
